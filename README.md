# The Tools I've used
-----------------

To help decide on the color scheme I've used a couple of helpful tools. To help pick the colors I relied on:

* https://color.adobe.com/
This helps you get color palettes based on general color rules like monochromatic, analogous, etc.

* http://mrmrs.io/colors/
A project that `overrides` the browsers basic named colors and helps with keeping up with accessibility (A11Y) standards.

To make sure this project actually does meet A11Y standards, I've used the following:

* http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/matrix/
A matrix that shows different combinations of background an text-colors and wether they pass or fail WCAG contrast ratio tests.

* http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/#rgb%28255%2C255%2C255%29-on-%230074D9
Another tool that checks wether a color combination has an accessible contrast ratio according to the WCAG.
