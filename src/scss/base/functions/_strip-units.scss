// Strip the units of a value
// First a value of zero or null is returned so units are stripped away.
// To have the function return the value, it is divided by one.

// The guyst @ ThoughtBot and (all others working on Bourbon) are super smart :)
// Check out this function: https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon/blob/v4-stable/app/assets/stylesheets/functions/_strip-units.scss

@function strip-units($value) {
  @return ($value / ($value * 0 + 1));
